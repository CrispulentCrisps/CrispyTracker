Driver engine

- = Features = -
Play individual notes

Refer to instrument values for:
	- Volume [includes panning]
	- Effect state [pitch mod, echo, noise]
	- Gain
	- ADSR envelope information
	- Sample index for SCRN registers
	
Process effects including:
	- Arpeggios
	- Portamento
	- Vibrato
	- Tremolando
	- Volume slides
	- Panning state
	- Retriggering notes
	- Changing echo state
	- Global panning and volume
	- Arp Speed control
	- Tracker Speed control
	- Flag communication between the main CPU and SPC-700
	- Halting tune

Have patterns to repeat written sequences of notes
Store samples as brr files
Allow for multiple tracks in a single SPC file

Allow for SFX to be played in any channel at any point in time

The engine process will be split up into 3 main sections

Table Construction
Handling Row Commands
Effects Processing

- Table Construction -

Tables will be constructed into the following tables:
	Instrument Table:
		int8_t Vol_L;			//Left channel volume
		int8_t Vol_R;			//Right channel volume
		uint8_t ADSR1;			//EDDD AAAA ADSR enable (E), decay rate (D), attack rate (A).
		uint8_t ADSR2;			//SSSR RRRR Sustain level (S), sustain rate (R).
		uint8_t Gain;			//0VVV VVVV Value(V).
		uint8_t EffectState;	//Holds the state of the effects in the instrument to reference in DSP memory
		uint8_t SampleIndex;	//Index of the sample, to be used by SCRN registers while they look in the DIR page
		uint8_t Priority;		//Priority system for SFX/Instrument priority
	
	Pitch Table:
		Pitch table will be preprocessed values that hold absolute pitch values, as such it will be stored as a uint16_t

- Row Commands -

Each row contains the following values:
	Note
	Instrument
	Volume
	Effect
	Effect Value

	These will be affected by command bytes that are used for every row, listed below are the set:
		[xx, name, args : args, information]
		//Controls
		00, End Of Row, Skip, dicates that the end of the row has been reach, waits Skip rows 
		01, Speed, S, Changes Tick threshold to S

		//Note
		1x, Play Note, Pitch : channel index, Pitch is an index into a pitch table, plays in channel X
		1x+8, Play Note, Pitch : channel index, Pitch is an absolute pitch, plays in channel X

		//Instrument
		2x, Set Instrument, Index, Sets the current intstrument in channel x
		
		//Special
		30, Set Noise Value, Pitch, takes in a 5 bit value for the noise pitch. Noise is universal across the SNES
		31, Echo Delay, D, Sets the delay amount for the echo [note: due to the nature of echo this can be EXTREMELY VOLATILE, so checks will absolutely have to be in place]
		32, Echo Volume, L : R, Sets the L+R volume for the echo
		33, Echo Feedback, F, Sets the feedback of the echo
		3x+4, Echo Coeffecients, C, Sets the filter coeffecients [note: Values < -128 or > 127 can cause issues]

		//Volume
		40, Set Master Volume, LPAN : RPAN
		4x+1, Set Volume, LPAN : RPAN, Sets the master volume of channel X [Also used in Panning effect. Used in conjunction with L/R inversion]

		//Effects
		5x, Set Effect Flags, V, Sets the flag state for the effect flags as a bitfield in X channel
		58, Set Arp Value, A, puts XY into A	[Note 1 : Note 2] 
		59, Set Port Value, P, puts XX into P 	[Portamento Val]
		5A, Set Vib Value, V, puts XY into V 	[Speed : Depth]
		5B, Set Trem Value, T, puts XY into T 	[Speed : Depth]
		5C, Set Vol Slide Value, S, puts XY into S 	[Up : Down]
		5D, Set Retrig Value, R, puts XX into R [Thresh]
		5E, Set Pbr Value, B, puts XY into B	[Speed : Depth]

- Effects Processing -

Effects will be categorised into 3 types
	Type 1: DSP Writes; these will be effects that directly change register values in the DSP. This could potentially be a volatile system due to how the SNES handles things like delay buffers or coeffecients, so take care.
	Type 2: Flag Effects; these will continue to affect the state of the channel as long as the effect is on. This includes Arps, Vibrato, Tremolando, Volume slides, Panbrello and Portamento.
	Type 3: Communication Effects; these will act as values that the track can write to that will be sent to the main CPU.

Effects list goes as:
	00xy Arpeggio [x: offset 1, y: offset 2] Semitone offset from base note
	01xx Portamento up [xx: speed up] Slides the pitch upwards
	02xx Portamento down [xx: speed down] Slides the pitch downwards
	03xx Portamento to [xx: speed toward] Slides the pitch to the desired note
	04xy Vibrato [x: speed, y: depth] Oscillates the pitch of the note
	05xy Tremolando [x: speed, y: depth] Oscillates the volume of the note

	08xy Panning [x: left, y: right] Sets the panning of the channel
	09xx Speed [xx: speed] Sets the speed of the track
	0Axy Volume Slide [x: up, y: down] Changes the instrument volume
	0Bxx Goto [xx: set order position] Sets position within orders
	0Cxx Retrigger [xx: frames between triggers] Plays the note the amount of frames specified
	0Dxx Break. Goes to next order
	0Exy Panbrello [x: speed, y: depth] Oscillates the panning of the note

	30xx Echo Delay [xx: echo value] sets the delay value of the echo [Note! Every echo value consumes 2048 bytes of Audio Ram, this may cause issues within the ROM export and may not be able to fit within the SPC Export!]
	31xx Echo Feedback [xx: feedback] Sets the Feedback of the echo. A value of 80 is equivelant to a feedback of 0
	32xx Echo L Volume [xx: left value] Sets the volume of the Echo Left channel. A value of 80 is equivelant to a feedback of 0
	33xx Echo R Volume [xx: right value] Sets the volume of the Echo Right channel. A value of 80 is equivelant to a feedback of 0
	34xx Echo Filter Value 1 [xx: value] Sets the value for the Echo Filter [Note! the whole filter buffer can only be from -128 to 127 TOTAL]
	35xx Echo Filter Value 2 [xx: value] Sets the value for the Echo Filter [Note! the whole filter buffer can only be from -128 to 127 TOTAL]
	36xx Echo Filter Value 3 [xx: value] Sets the value for the Echo Filter [Note! the whole filter buffer can only be from -128 to 127 TOTAL]
	37xx Echo Filter Value 4 [xx: value] Sets the value for the Echo Filter [Note! the whole filter buffer can only be from -128 to 127 TOTAL]
	38xx Echo Filter Value 5 [xx: value] Sets the value for the Echo Filter [Note! the whole filter buffer can only be from -128 to 127 TOTAL]
	39xx Echo Filter Value 6 [xx: value] Sets the value for the Echo Filter [Note! the whole filter buffer can only be from -128 to 127 TOTAL]
	3Axx Echo Filter Value 7 [xx: value] Sets the value for the Echo Filter [Note! the whole filter buffer can only be from -128 to 127 TOTAL]
	3Bxx Echo Filter Value 8 [xx: value] Sets the value for the Echo Filter [Note! the whole filter buffer can only be from -128 to 127 TOTAL]

	E1xy Portamento ctrl up [x: semitone, y: speed] Slides the note pitch up by X semitones at Y speed
	E2xy Portamento ctrl down [x: semitone, y: speed] Slides the note pitch down by X semitones at Y speed
	E8xx Set Global Left Panning Volume [xx: l value] Sets the Global Left panning of the tune
	E9xx Set Global Right Panning Volume [xx: r value] Sets the Global Right panning of the tune
