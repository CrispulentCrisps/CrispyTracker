# CrispyTracker
 A snes based tracker with export.

# Reason
There seems to be no good or effecient way to make snes music without turning to programs without an export, I've seen the dire state and wanted to throw my hat into the ring to see what I can manage.
Now, this is a group project, but life can get in the way and must be prioritised so progress may be slow.
I intend for this project to be free and open source, as this is what I believe is the best way to store programs, so any contributions or suggestions can be throw at me!
